I had a problem where either the test dll would not load or the tests would not run (stay blue)
This took almost 24 hours to figure out.
The same solution would run on my laptop.
Eventually figured out it was becasue the output test.dll files were on a network drive (in a VM).
There were many suggestiones for how to fix, and many different config files suggested, but none worked until I tried this one:


<configuration>
   <runtime>
      <loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true"/>
   </runtime>
...

Put into these:


"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\machine.config"

"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\machine.config"
